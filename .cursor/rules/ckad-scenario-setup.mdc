# CKAD Scenario Setup Rules

## Setup File Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Only include resources in setup that are prerequisites or context. Do NOT include resources that the user is supposed to create as part of their task.

### ✅ Include in setup:
- Namespaces (always required)
- Existing deployments, services, configmaps that provide context
- Prerequisites that the user needs but shouldn't create themselves

### ❌ Don't include in setup:
- Pods, deployments, or other resources the user must create themselves
- Solution files for tasks where the user creates resources
- Any resource that is the main focus of the user's task

### Examples:
- If the task is "create a pod named cache", the setup should only include the namespace
- If the task is "configure a service for an existing deployment", the setup should include the deployment but not the service
- If the task is "create a deployment", don't include the deployment in setup

## Scenario Structure
- Each scenario must have a `setup/` directory with `namespace.yaml` and `kustomization.yaml`
- The `kustomization.yaml` should only reference resources that are prerequisites
- No solution files should be included when the user creates the main resources

This ensures scenarios properly test the user's ability to create resources while providing necessary context and prerequisites.
